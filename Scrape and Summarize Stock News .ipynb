       " <p>Markets are down significantly from record highs; in fact, the NASDAQ has entered correction territory, with a decline of 15% while the S&amp;P 500’s decline is still at ~9%. These price declines come as the Federal Reserve signaled it will be raising rates this year. While higher interest rates will knock down inflation, stock markets are likely to take a tumble when the hikes come – and analysts are predicting anywhere from 2 to 4 rate hikes this year. The end of the central bank’s supportive policy will make for a rocky ride ahead.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The immediate short-term effect, as investors prepare the change in policy, is the correction we’re seeing. This means that investors will likely find solid buying opportunities coming up -- at least according to Nadia Lovell, senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p>,\n",
       " <p>“The market has had a choppy start to the year, but it does feel like most of the selling might be behind us.. We’ll use the opportunity of indiscriminate selling to build a position over the long term... There’s an opportunity to build in high-quality names with sustainable business models,” Lovell noted.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Against this backdrop, we used <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:TipRanks database\" href=\"https://click.tipranks.com/WJho/8645564c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TipRanks database</a> to find 3 cheap stocks. Essentially, we looked for 1) stocks with a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus; 2) serious upside potential (i.e. over 50%). And on top of this, each one of these stocks is trading at 52-week low valuations. Let's take a closer look.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Alteryx</strong> <strong>(<a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:AYX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ayx/stock-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AYX</a>)</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>The first stock on our radar is Alteryx, a California-based software company with a range of products to power data analytics and machine learning, making it possible for enterprise clients to make decisions, fine-tune end-user products, and streamline operations based on real-time information. The company dates back to the 1990s tech boom, and currently boasts over 7,000 customer companies worldwide.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Alteryx will release its 4Q21 numbers next month, but a look back at the third quarter results may be informative. Specifically, the top line of $124 million and the EPS loss of 18 cents per share were both slightly ahead of Street expectation. Furthermore, annual recurring revenue (ARR), an important forward-looking metric, grew 29% year-over-year, to reach $578.6 million.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The company finished Q3 with solid assets – cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, and a nine-month cash from operations total of $24.3 million, up 49% from the prior year. Alteryx felt confident enough earlier this month to announce its acquisition of the data analytics company Trifacta for $400 million in cash.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Despite these positive signs for the company, Alteryx shares tumbled 59% over the past 12 months.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Covering the stock for JMP, 5-star analyst Patrick Walravens writes that he remains bullish on Alteryx, including among his reasons: “1) the company offers a strong solution set that competes very well in a massive TAM, estimated to be ~$49B; 2) the acquisition of Trifacta should help Alteryx expand its TAM by providing additional opportunities to target new data and cloud transformation initiatives, particularly in the Global 2000, of which ~39% are Alteryx customers; 3) Alteryx is investing more in its cloud capabilities with Designer Cloud, and we expect the company to benefit over time as its cloud capabilities mature and as its product portfolio gradually becomes available in the cloud…”</p>,\n",
       " <p>To this end, Walravens rates AYX an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $159 price target. Possible gains of 211% could be heading investors’ way should the target be met over the next 12 months. (To watch Walravens’ track record, <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:click here\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/patrick-walravens\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p>,\n",
       " <p>Overall, there are 7 recent analyst reviews here, breaking down 6 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold and supporting the Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $50.44 and its $101 average price target implies a one-year upside of ~100%.

       " <p><strong>Duck Creek Technologies</strong> <strong>(<a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:DCT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dct/stock-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DCT</a>)</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>With the next stock, we’ll switch over to the East Coast, where Boston-based software company Duck Creek Technologies has made its mark in the insurance industry. Duck Creek produces cloud-based software industry-specific to the insurance sector, a large market with specific needs in accounting, underwriting, and other financial activities. The company’s software has found users among the industry’s biggest names, including AIG, Geico, and Liberty Mutual, and is also popular among smaller, regional players.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The company went public in August of 2020, and its stock generally held between $40 and $50 per share, before it collapsed in October 2021. The collapse came after Duck Creek released earnings for fiscal 4Q 2021 – and showed a serious GAAP loss of 13 cents per share for the year. Shares haven’t really recovered, and DCT is down 55% since one year ago.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In its fiscal 1Q22 report, however, released this month, Duck Creek showed a definite turnaround. GAAP income switched year-over-year from a 4-cent loss to a 1 cent profit; by non-GAAP measures, the profit was 4 cents per share. At the top line, revenue came in at $73.4 million, for a yoy gain of 25%, and the company finished its fiscal Q1 with $347.6 million in liquid assets and no debt.</p>,\n",
       " <p>All of this bodes well for the future, and writing from Raymond James, analyst Alexander Sklar sets out a similarly upbeat view: “DCT continues to execute on its land and expand strategy with 3 new core system logos, and SaaS net dollar retention of 122% that increased q/q and y/y. While the timing of Tier 1 core modernization activity remains difficult to predict, DCT appears to have several at bats in its late stage pipeline that could be additive to our near term outlook. With a long term (albeit lumpy) secular growth opportunity at its back, we remain positive on DCT’s positioning to capture an outsized share of incremental deal activity over the next several years.”</p>,\n",
       " <p>Unsurprisingly, Sklar gives DCT shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $36 target price indicates an upside of ~54% in the next 12 months. (To watch Sklar’s track record, <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:click here\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/alexander-sklar\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p>,\n",
       " <p>Wall Street is in broad agreement about this stock’s positive outlook; the 8 recent reviews include 7 Buys against just 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $23.56 and the $38.25 average price target suggests ~63% upside from that level.

       " <p>Last but not least is Elastic, an American-Dutch company offering SaaS software solutions for searching, security, access logs, observability, and analytics. The company’s software has found its place among some of the business world’s biggest names, names as diverse as Adobe, Audi, T-Mobile, and Walmart. Elastic gives customers – from major corporations to small-time bloggers – the ability to explore, parse, and analyze their data through customizable search functions.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Elastic has shown a classic ‘growth stock’ profile, with rising revenues and regular quarterly EPS losses as the company channels funds into development and marketing initiatives. A quick look at the most recent quarterly release, for fiscal 2Q22, shows the story. The company reported $206 million at the top line, up 42% year-over-year, a total that included an 84% gain in Elastic Cloud Revenue, to $69 million. At the same time, sales and marketing spending grew from $64.4 million one year ago to $94.9 million in the current quarter, an increase of 47%. Elastic’s GAAP operating loss came to $37.2 million, or 51 cents per share. The non-GAAP loss was 9 cents per share.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Investors would appear to be growing cautious here, possibly due to the recurring losses and possibly also as an artifact of a larger market shift from growth to value stocks. Also weighing on investors, the company has been reshuffling its upper management this month. CEO Shay Banon stepped aside to resume his old CTO position, while Ashutosh Kulkarni has been promoted to the CEO position. Overall, ESTC shares are down 58% from their November 2021 peak price.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Matthew Hedberg, 5-star analyst from RBC, covers Elastic, and he notes both the management shuffle and the solid revenue performance. His bottom line is, the shuffle may be positive, while the company is poised to keep delivering increasing sales. He writes: “Timing-wise, a transition like this is never easy as management noted the logical time was the start of a new calendar year as they continue to feel good about their products and go-to-market momentum... Overall, we continue to believe the combination of an expanding product stack including a mix-shift to Elastic Cloud that seems to be accelerating customer additions and potentially additional growth disclosures (we'd like to see ARR) could push shares higher.”</p>,\n",
       " <p>These comments support Hedberg’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $165 price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~110%.

       " <p>All in all, this company has attracted plenty of analyst attention, with a total of 13 recent reviews. These include 10 Buy and 3 Holds to back a Strong Buy consensus. The average price target of $168.55 suggests an upside of ~114% form the current share price of $79.

       "\" Markets are down significantly from record highs; in fact, the NASDAQ has entered correction territory, with a decline of 15% while the S&P 500’s decline is still at ~9%. These price declines come as the Federal Reserve signaled it will be raising rates this year. While higher interest rates will knock down inflation, stock markets are likely to take a tumble when the hikes come – and analysts are predicting anywhere from 2 to 4 rate hikes this year. The end of the central bank’s supportive policy will make for a rocky ride ahead. The immediate short-term effect, as investors prepare the change in policy, is the correction we’re seeing. This means that investors will likely find solid buying opportunities coming up -- at least according to Nadia Lovell, senior U.S. equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. “The market has had a choppy start to the year, but it does feel like most of the selling might be behind us.. We’ll use the opportunity of indiscriminate selling to build a position over the long term... There’s an opportunity to build in high-quality names with sustainable business models,” Lovell noted. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks database to find 3 cheap stocks. Essentially, we looked for 1) stocks with a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus; 2) serious upside potential (i.e. over 50%). And on top of this, each one of these stocks is trading at 52-week low valuations. Let's take a closer look. Alteryx (AYX) The first stock on our radar is Alteryx, a California-based software company with a range of products to power data analytics and machine learning, making it possible for enterprise clients to make decisions, fine-tune end-user products, and streamline operations based on real-time information. The company dates back to the 1990s tech boom, and currently boasts over 7,000 customer companies worldwide. Alteryx will release its 4Q21 numbers next month, but a look back at the third quarter results may be informative. Specifically, the top line of $124 million and the EPS loss of 18 cents per share were both slightly ahead of Street expectation. Furthermore, annual recurring revenue (ARR), an important forward-looking metric, grew 29% year-over-year, to reach $578.6 million. The company finished Q3 with solid assets – cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, and a nine-month cash from operations total of $24.3 million, up 49% from the prior year. Alteryx felt confident enough earlier\""

In its place, Google today announced a new proposal: Topics. The idea here is that your browser will learn about your interests as you move around the web. It'll keep data for the last three weeks of your browsing history and as of now, Google is restricting the number of topics to 300, with plans to extend this over time. Google notes that these topics will not include any sensitive categories like gender or race. To figure out your interests, Google categorizes the sites you visit based on one of these 300 topics. For sites that it hasn't categorized before, a lightweight machine learning algorithm in the browser will take over and provide an estimated topic based on the name of the domain. Image Credits: Google When you hit upon a site that supports the Topics API for ad purposes, the browser will share three topics you are interested in -- one for each of the three last weeks -- selected randomly from your top five topics of each week. The site can then share this with its advertising partners to decide which ads to show you. Ideally, this would make for a more private method of deciding which ad to show you\",\n",
       "  \" By Paresh Dave (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on Tuesday announced its second try at enabling advertisers to buy ads based on users' browsing interests without having to rely on what it has described as privacy-invasive tracking cookies. Google wants to block tracking cookies in its Chrome web browser by the end of next year, which would prevent advertising companies from logging the websites someone is visiting. Advertisers, website owners and privacy groups have all raised alarms over the planned transition, and complaints have led antitrust authorities in the United States, United Kingdom and elsewhere to watch Google's plans closely. Online ad buyers and sellers are weighing successors to the cookies. Options include tracking users by asking for their email addresses to access websites or adopting new technologies that Google, Mozilla and other browser makers could build into their software. Google's initial solution, known as Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoC, aimed to constantly group people into big baskets designed by algorithms based on websites users visited in the last week. Advertisers could show ads to a preferred basket, but they would not know the individuals in it or what interest they shared in common. But in tests last year, some advertisers found FLoC less effective than cookies for choosing users to target and the system carried the risk of exposing an individual's browsing history, Google product director Vinay\",\n",
       "  'Mustafa Suleyman, a co-founder of artificial intelligence research company DeepMind, has left Google to join venture capital firm Greylock Partners. Suleyman has brought to an end an eight-year run at Google, where he was most recently the company’s vice president of AI product management and policy. He joined Google when it bought DeepMind in 2014 and became the latter’s head of applied AI. Suleyman was reportedly placed on administrative leave in 2019 following allegations that he bullied employees. Suleyman, who moved to Google at the end of that year, said on a podcast with Greylock partner Reid Hoffman this week that he \"really screwed up\" and that “I remain very sorry about the impact that that caused people and the hurt that people felt there.” As The New York Times notes, Suleyman was among those who resisted Google\\'s AI endeavors with the US Department of Defense. Google ended up backing out of that project, though in November it said it was making a bid for the Pentagon\\'s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability cloud contract. DeepMind may be best known for its AI systems that can compete with the best human players of certain games. Google has also employed DeepMind\\'s knowhow to improve arrival time estimates in Google Maps, track wildlife and detect breast cancer. Investors looking to add growth stocks to their portfolios this month shouldn\\'t miss these names. Upsetting signs',\n",

InstaDeep, a Tunis and London-based enterprise AI startup that creates decision-making systems for solving real-world problems, has raised $100 million in Series B financing led by Alpha Intelligence Capital and CDIB. BioNTech (the company behind Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine), Chimera Abu Dhabi, Deutsche Bahn’s DB Digital Ventures, Google, G42 and Synergie participated in the round. InstaDeep was founded by Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim in 2014. The Tunisian startup, headquartered in London with offices in Paris, Tunis, Lagos, Dubai and Cape Town, uses advanced machine learning techniques to bring AI to applications within an enterprise environment. Beguir, the chief executive officer, on a call with TechCrunch, said the eight-year-old company’s AI and machine learning solves an array of challenges. They can range from a large shipping company finding ways to efficiently transport thousands of containers to a railway station, with more than 30,000 kilometres of railway, trying to automate scheduling for 10,000 trains. Other examples are the design of advanced therapeutics with silicon and routing components on a printed circuit board. These types',\n",

The Verge sources claim Google is developing an augmented reality headset, nicknamed Project Iris, that it wants to release in 2024. The standalone wearable would use a custom Google processor, outward-facing tracking cameras and run Android, although a custom OS is a possibility given job listings. It might also rely on cloud-based rendering to overcome the processing power limitations of a headset. Clay Bavor, the manager for the Project Starline 3D telepresence booth (also said due for 2024), is understood to be overseeing the highly secretive project. The tipsters also said the AR headset team included Google Assistant creator Scott Huffman, ARCore manager Shahram Izadi and Mark Lucovsky, the former leader of Meta\\'s in-house OS development. The Pixel division is also believed to be involved in some hardware work. We\\'ve asked Google for comment, although CEO Sundar Pichai hinted in October that AR was a \"major area of investment\" for the company. The headset is supposedly very early in development without a clear market strategy, suggesting that the 2024 target isn\\'t firm.

Documentation and code sleuthing have reportedly revealed the codename \"Boreal,\" while 9to5 understood the Android TV media hub would launch later in 2022. The purported leak doesn\\'t mention specifications, although newer processing power with broader video support might be necessary. XDA and others have heard Android TV will require AV1 video format support after March 31st, and that\\'s conspicuously absent on the existing Chromecast with Google TV. The company might also use the opportunity to address common complaints, such as the modest storage. Provided the leak is accurate, the question is whether or not this is a straightforward replacement for the existing Chromecast or a higher-powered separate model. Given that the existing Chromecast already supports 4K HDR, though, a replacement seems more likely. It\\'s clear any changes would be substantial enough to warrant a new internal nickname — Google doesn\\'t typically hand out names for minor revisions.

BofA cited a “more reasonable valuation” that has come about as being the main reason for the upgrade. “We’ve been bearish on MRNA shares for some time based on what we thought were overly optimistic Street assumptions on [COVID-19] boosters,” the report reads. “As valuation has compressed (last 4 months: -65%; NBI (^NBI) index: -21%) and as we move from pandemic to endemic stages, we are focusing more on the pipeline beyond Spikevax.” Moderna has seen immense growth from its IPO in December 2018, since becoming a household name as one of the leading global producers of a vaccine against COVID-19. The company develops medical treatments and pharmaceuticals leveraging its research and technology in the area of messenger RNA, or mRNA. As of late, Moderna’s stock has slumped, falling over 60% since a September 2021 peak of nearly $450 and trading a little over $150 today.

But by Wednesday, the coin’s price had risen back to $43,000 and many financial leaders are predicting Bitcoin to surpass $75,000 before the year ends. The quick recovery proved to many crypto enthusiasts that Bitcoin is here to stay. Now, some investors are highlighting Bitcoin for the opportunity it presents at leveling the playing field, particularly for Black Americans, many of whom have been disadvantaged by traditional banks for decades. “Bitcoin is absolutely a tool for social justice,” Charlene Fadirepo, a former audit manager at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors turned Bitcoin adviser, told Yahoo Finance. “If you think about Black Americans, we believe that Bitcoin allows [us] to build generational wealth. And not just Black Americans … Latino Americans, the LGBT communities and Indigenous communities. It allows communities to build wealth in communities that have been left out of the discriminatory banking system that we have today.” Fadirepo called 2021 a “breakout year” for Bitcoin, noting that major banks had had high-net-worth clients invest in it and large corporations have begun accumulating Bitcoin and holding onto it as an asset.

The move will also review the impact of digital assets on financial stability, and normalizing regulations for crypto with other countries.

       "  'By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Medha Singh (Reuters) - Bitcoin is growing up. The original cryptocurrency turns 13 this year and is showing signs of becoming a more mature financial asset - but watch out for the teenage tantrums. This drift towards the mainstream, driven by the big bets of institutional investors, has seen bitcoin become sensitive to interest rates and fuelled a sell-off in the coin this month as investors braced for a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting. The cryptocurrency, born in 2009, was still on the fringes of finance during the Fed\\'s previous tightening cycle, from 2016 to 2019, and was barely correlated with the stock market. Times have changed. Bitcoin has been positively correlated with the S&P 500 index since early 2020, according to Refinitiv data, meaning they broadly move up and down together. Their correlation coefficient has risen to 0.41 now from 0.1 in September, where zero means no correlation and 1 implies perfectly synchronised movement. By contrast, that coefficient was just 0.01 in 2017-2019, according to an International Monetary Fund analysis published this month. \"Now that bitcoin is not entirely held by early adopters, it\\'s sitting in a 60/40 type portfolio,\" said Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of Arizona-based IDX Digital Assets, referring to the institutional strategy of allocating 60% of a portfolio to relatively risky equities and 40% towards bonds. \"It\\'s not surprising that',\n",
       "  \" Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) performance may be heavily correlated with risk assets like long-term tech stocks, according to an industry expert. “Now we have a non-zero correlation between Bitcoin and risk assets, in particular long duration tech stocks, things like that,” said Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and a co-founder of Coin Metrics in a recent Yahoo Finance Live segment. “And that's the flip side of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being financialized and being incorporated into the mainstream financial apparatus: you're exposed to the behavior of more mainstream investors.” Bitcoin continued falling this week, yet still has stayed afloat above the precipitous “death cross” threshold — a bearish indicator occurring when the 50-day moving average drops below the 200-day moving average. At the time of writing, Bitcoin hovered around $42,000, down about 10% in the last month and more than 35% from it's all-time highs. Similarly, tech stocks have faltered within the past few months. Macroeconomic issues have had a hand in dampening prospects for risk assets to begin the year, as inflation concerns dominate national financial headlines. Last month’s Consumer Price Index report measured inflation of 7%, the highest level since the early 1980s. The Federal Reserve has told the public that it would commence with a more hawkish monetary policy to curtail rampant inflation in 2022, which could mean two, three, or even four rate hikes.\",\n",

Investors think the relatively stable trading band masks the risk of more wild swings triggered by a short squeeze, but the jury is still out on whether Bitcoin has set a base at current levels.\\xa0 Cryptocurrencies have been highly correlated with risk-sensitive assets, falling in sympathy with volatile Wall Street stocks: in Wednesday\\'s session, the Nasdaq Composite hit correction territory and dragged digital tokens lower, with Bitcoin pinned below $42,000.\\xa0 However, bulls remain convinced that the currency has more upside than down.\\xa0 “This is now a very resilient asset class,” LMAX Group CEO David Mercer told Yahoo Finance Live last week. “This sell off is to be expected in what is still quite a thinly traded and small asset class within wider capital market.\" Even if Bitcoin trades back toward $30,000, however, \"just the sheer weight of institutional money that\\'s coming, and if you speak to anyone, every banker, every asset manager has a strategy for crypto.

Like stocks, Bitcoin's short-term outlook is being determined by a Federal Reserve that's taken a decisive turn toward fighting inflation — heightening fears of higher interest rates — and away from loose monetary policy that boosts cryptocurrencies.\\xa0 One thing that Bitcoin still has going for it: a yearly return of more than 11% as of Tuesday that's more favorable than the current 7% rate of consumer inflation — the hottest in decades. That puts it in rare company; bonds, gold, commodities and real estate are also touted as legitimate hedges of inflation. Even at its brief but bearish moment below $34,000, the cryptocurrency functioned as protection against soaring inflation, a thesis that isn't quite accepted as truth but is compelling nonetheless, especially for developing economies with limited access to financial markets. History repeats itself: BTC below $14,000 Jon Wolfenbarger, CEO and Founder of Bull and Bear Profits, who previously told Yahoo Finance that\",\n",
       "  ' The new year has not been kind to cryptocurrencies, which rose on Wednesday despite about a week of selling that briefly drove Bitcoin below $40,000. A jittery market has begun 2022 on a sour note, with a suddenly hawkish Federal Reserve and the Omicron wave of COVID-19 infections making investors risk-averse. Meanwhile, Bitcoin set a new low at $39,893.62 — having swooned by more than 40% since its November peak. Bitcoin has shed over 8% at its weakest levels this week, while smaller tokens like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and Terra have fallen even harder. All have clawed back within the last day. Despite Wednesday\\'s rebound, it\\'s far too early to call a trend reversal in the sell-off given trading volume on major crypto exchanges, Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst with Tokyo-based crypto exchange Bitbank, told Yahoo Finance this week. After clearing the hurdle of Fed Chair Jerome Powell\\'s confirmation hearing for a second term, investors are nervously anticipating inflation data that will shape sentiment in the near term, with crypto continuing to trade almost lock-step with technology stocks. Bitcoin\\'s price range for the rest of the week should range between $40,000 and $48,000, Hasegawa said — but admitted that \"it certainly is not a time for optimism in the short run.\"\\xa0 The start of a rate hike campaign, which threatens to withdraw the liquidity and tame the inflation that have',\n",

       " 'ETH': [' The Biden administration is preparing to release a government-wide strategy to regulate cryptocurrencies as early as February, with the market in the throes of a deep rout linked to uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation. According to an administration official, the forthcoming National Security Council (NSC) memorandum will task federal agencies to assess the risks and opportunities that crypto poses, and delve into the details of a central bank digital currency. The move will also review the impact of digital assets on financial stability, and normalizing regulations for crypto with other countries. The action, first reported by Bloomberg News, comes as agencies across the government examine new rules for crypto. Last fall, the Biden administration released recommendations proposing that only banks be allowed to issue stablecoins. Digital coins have been battered by the market’s risk aversion. At its weakest levels on Monday, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was off 50% from an all-time high near $69,000, as cryptocurrencies got clobbered amidst investor angst over the Fed’s interest rate hikes, and Washington policymakers mulling regulation of the sector. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), one of bitcoin’s most vocal advocates on Capitol Hill, is expected to introduce a bill on regulating crypto that aims to fully integrate digital assets into the financial system. Her legislation would give guidance on which assets belong in which asset class and offer up new rules on taxing',\n",
       "  'During the last ten years, we have been witnessing massive changes in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin, for example, went from being an interesting experiment for a mainstream investor portfolio mainstay to a new asset class and digital gold. Several factors support higher Bitcoin prices, including better acceptance by traditional companies and the rising demand from Bitcoin ETFs. Experts say Bitcoin has the possibility of topping $100,000 by the end of 2023 but some analysts argue that this goal could be reached already by the end of the first quarter of 2022. Several others are still cautious to choose a specific date or year and expect Bitcoin to not reach more than $70,000 by the end of 2022. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said she expects Bitcoin to tank to as low as $10,000 in 2022, virtually wiping out all of its gains in the past year and a half. Ethereum also generated its momentum throughout 2021 and it is important to recognise how its price value jumped after the ETH 2.0 upgrade was announced to be launched. This upgrade project is expected to be continued in 2022 as well, which analysts claim is one of the major factors that will lead to an ETH price jump – up to $6,000 by the end of 2022.

       "  ' Through this upgrade, partial transaction fees are permanently burned, reducing the circulating ETH supply. A similar upgrade will affect the Polygon network, potentially making MATIC a deflationary token. The upgrade of Ethereum to EIP-1559 has some exciting consequences. A partial network fee burning mechanism is a great way to reduce the circulating supply of tokens on the network. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has no “hard cap,” even though it has block reward reductions for miners. Moreover, once the transition to proof-of-stake occurs, that reward reduction schedule will remain in effect. Ethereum enabled this upgrade through the London hard fork in the summer of 2021. As a result, network enthusiasts now benefit from better gas price predictability — although transactions can still be rather expensive — and network fee burning. More specifically, the network upgrade has burned over 1.58 million Ether, or over $4.5 billion. Although this has caused the ETH supply to flatten a bit, it has not triggered a deflationary effect yet. Before the deflationary effect can become a reality, the network rewards will need to drop further. Another option is having the network process even more transactions – and subsequently, burning more fees — although Ethereum has been running at near-full capacity for some time. Better scaling will be required, which will occur through sharding in the next upgrade. There is no date for that upgrade today, though,',\n",
       "  ' With 2021 winding down and 2022 hopefully being the year of the Merge, I wanted to do a deeper dive into five of the top things to expect with Ethereum’s impending transition to proof-of-stake. The Merge itself will not be as initially glamorous as many market participants and outsiders may believe. However, the underlying improvements and the foundation it sets will allow Ethereum to onboard millions of users without sacrificing decentralization. Lower energy consumption – Changing Ethereum’s consensus layer to proof-of-stake rids the network of miners and replaces them with validators. Under proof-of-work, Ethereum requires miners to compete for hash power by consuming electricity. By using randomness to assign block production, proof-of-stake is able to run with significantly lower energy consumption. The Ethereum Foundation predicts that after the Merge the network will use at least 99.95% less energy than it does in its current state. Deflationary ether – An Ethereum research report modeled the impact the combination of EIP 1559 and proof-of-stake will have on ether’s circulating supply. The transaction fee burn combined with lower rewards and ether locked for validating will drive the circulating supply equilibrium down to between 27.3 and 49.5 million ETH. For comparison, the current supply is sitting at 118 million ETH and is still slightly inflationary after the addition of EIP 1559.

With many Canadians learning how to start investing during the pandemic, the cryptocurrency industry also saw a significant influx of money from retail and institutional investors, driving the speculative industry to greater heights. Many of the top cryptocurrencies posted impressive growth due to the rising interest in this space. The choice between Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) has been one of the biggest debates in the crypto industry for several years. Bitcoin has remained at the top in the industry, being the first cryptocurrency and the asset that paved the way for thousands of cryptocurrencies over the years. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, and it has plenty of room to cover before it can catch up with Bitcoin. The second-largest cryptocurrency has to see considerable growth to surpass the world’s top cryptocurrency. It might seem impossible for Ethereum to beat Bitcoin to those bullish on Bitcoin, but ETH’s growth rate has outpaced that of BTC in recent years. Today, I will discuss why Ethereum could oust Bitcoin as the top crypto soon. One of the most significant challenges plaguing Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry is the energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol that maintains the blockchain network and validates transactions.

In the meme-induced fog of propaganda between Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum boosters, it might be hard to keep track of the big themes, but I believe two overarching ones will shape the world of blockchain in the coming year. Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. First and foremost, 2022 is all about Ethereum. Just about everything innovative and important happening in the world of blockchain right now is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem. I see three key trends driving growth in the Ethereum ecosystem in the coming year. First, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represent the future of how communities, missions and enterprises are converging in a single format. While DAOs have been around for a while, I see 2022 as the year in which they start to take center stage as a preferred format for building new entities. This will also be a critical year in which DAO governance will mature, as people get more comfortable exercising their voting power with stakes and delegating their voting power to those who are experts on particular topics. In the long run, this may well kick off a shareholder revolution in traditional markets as well. Read more:',\n",
